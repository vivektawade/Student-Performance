1. Dataset loaded and basic inspection performed (shape, info, head).
2. Descriptive statistics generated using describe().
3. Missing value percentage checked per column.
4. Distribution visualized using histograms and boxplots.
5. Outliers detected using IQR method on math score.
6. Outlier flag column created.
7. Outliers handled using capping method to avoid data loss.
8. Correlation matrix plotted to understand relationships.
9. Cleaned dataset exported for further analysis.

Conclusion:
EDA helps understand data structure, detect outliers, and improve data quality
before applying machine learning or business analysis.
